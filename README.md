# JuliaSCGA
JuliaSCGA is a Julia package that implements the self-consistent Gaussian approximation (SCGA) methodStarting from a general spin Hamiltonian that may incorpoarte isotropic/anisotropic exchange interactions and single ion anisotropy, JuliaSCGA calculates the spin-spin correlations in designated reciprocal space. Compared to other methods like the classical Monte Carlo simulations, the SCGA method provides an efficient way to analyze the diffuse neutron scattering pattern, and can also be utilized to determine the spin Hamiltonian through fits to the experimental data.
